Write a node program that takes in an unlimited number of command line arguments, goes through each and prints out the sum of them. If any argument is not a whole number, skip it. Do support negative numbers though.

- loop through all numbers
- what is a commnad line argument
- handle unlimited number or args
- why are we doing this?
- convert args to integers
- what are the data types
- write a function to sum the args

- method
- validations - edge cases
- why? - how do you present your answer
- 
- initialise a git repository
- create a repo on github
- push my code
